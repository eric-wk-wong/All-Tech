#### I. Business Scenario
An auto repair shop named All-Tech just opened its business in Fort Lee, New Jersey and offers 
services to any customers who would like to fix or reform their cars. The services and prices will differ 
depending on the car type, model, year, incurred miles, etc. and the types of equipment needed for a 
repair. Customers will have the choice of choosing their preferred equipment or parts, such as the brand of 
a tire and/or other materials. The auto repair shop employs many technicians skilled in various types of 
repairs (for example http://atlcarrepair.com/services/). The business also accepts a handful of insurance 
plans from their customers. Each customer might have different coverages and the shop is required to 
check the deductible, eligibility, coverage amount, and remaining balances of the insurance. Due to the 
various types of services provided, there are many different suppliers in which the shop is contracting for 
materials. The business strives to offer the best services to its customers, so all customer information will 
be managed by the shop. This, in turn, will increase the profit gained from utilizing customer eligible 
insurances, more reasonable pricing of materials with suppliers, higher retainment rate of existing 
customers, and an increase in new customer traction.

Our strategy applies database management systems to store and keep track of information. In 
addition, it maximizes our productivity by saving space and time spent on ordering new and reducing 
remaining equipment. Our techniques also aid in minimizing redundant information and allows us to 
make smart business decisions, such as expanding our workforce or finding alternative suppliers.
